On Android 9 goto:

- tab 7 times on `Build number`
- Enter phone pin

Now you are in developer mode and will find new menu-item `Developer options` at `Settings` / `System` / `Advanced`

Developer mode and selected options are persistend, even after reboot. But developer mode is automatically turned off after (security) update. You may also turn off Developer options manually.
