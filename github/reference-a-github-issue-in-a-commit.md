# Reference A GitHub-Issue In A Commit

- When creating a *new commit* to a file on GitHub, you may reference to an issue adressing that commit. 
- In master-branch just add a hashtag and the issue's number '#2' to create a link.
- Adding the keyword 'fix' to it automatically closes the issue.
- You may reference a certain commit by its hash-value: [4e5ef5ccda831dfc79c28ad4f1dcafcd4dae5fff](https://github.com/fulgor/TIL/commit/4e5ef5ccda831dfc79c28ad4f1dcafcd4dae5fff)
