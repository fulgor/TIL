# Add A License To A GitHub-Repo

- When creating a *new project* on GitHub, there is a license picker available. 
- With an already *existing project* you can [manually add a license](https://help.github.com/articles/adding-a-license-to-a-repository/) using the browser.
- But the list of licenses does not include creative commons.
