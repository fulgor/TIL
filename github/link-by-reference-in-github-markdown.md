# Link By Reference In GitHub Markdown

**This is how you create and organize links by reference in a github flavored md-file.**

This is an example for linking by reference [to fulgor's repos][fulgor github].
> `This is an example for linking by reference [to fulgor's repos][fulgor github].`

This is how you store the reference and URL:
> `[fulgor github]: https://github.com/fulgor?tab=repositories`

* Reference-links will be shown on your page, while reference-urls won't.
* You don't have to keep reference-urls in one place. You may store them on a page where ever you find it convenient.
